# Compiler for Simple Language of Expressions (E++)

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a compiler for a simple language of expressions, referred to as E++. The compiler is developed as part of an assignment for the course "Data Structures and Algorithms" at IIT Delhi. The primary objective of the compiler is to translate expressions written in E++ into equivalent code in a target language, designed to execute on a stack machine architecture.

## Features
- **Symbol Table Management**: Efficient management of symbol tables using AVL trees to optimize variable lookup and assignment.
- **Parse Tree Generation**: Implementation of a parser to generate parse trees from tokenized expressions, facilitating efficient syntax analysis.
- **Code Generation**: Generation of target language code from parse trees, ensuring compatibility with stack machine execution.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling mechanisms to detect and report syntax errors during compilation.

## Usage
To compile and run the compiler:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the source code using the provided Makefile.
4. Run the compiler on a set of valid E++ expressions to generate target code.
5. Execute the generated target code on a stack machine architecture for evaluation.
